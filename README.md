"Before Completion"
This project is the very first project on the Odin Project. The task
is to design a "Recipes" website using the various html skills I have
learnt.

Some skills which I have demonstrated include the ability to use images & links,
able to use paragraph, and heading tags correctly. Furthermore, I am able to use
both unordered and ordered lists and create html boilerplate successfully.
